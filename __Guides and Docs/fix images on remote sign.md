hat is a massive milestone! Seeing the data flow means your infrastructure is finally "solid." Now for the final layer: The Storage Security.

The reason images work locally but not on Railway is usually due to Environment Variable mismatches or Bucket Permissions. When using cloud storage (like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage), images often require "Signed URLs" (temporary access keys) to be viewed.   

Here is the checklist to get those images visible:

1. The "Amnesia" Variable (Again)
Just like VITE_API_URL, your backend needs specific keys to sign those URLs.

The Check: Go to your Railway Backend Service > Variables.

Are these present?

S3_KEY / AWS_ACCESS_KEY

S3_SECRET / AWS_SECRET_KEY

S3_BUCKET_NAME

S3_REGION

Common Mistake: On Railway, ensure you haven't wrapped the keys in quotes ("). It should be AKIA..., not "AKIA...".

2. The "Region" mismatch
Locally, your computer might be defaulting to a region (like us-east-1). Railway servers might be running in a different region. If the region in your variables doesn't match the bucket exactly, the "signature" generated by the backend will be invalid.

3. Check the "Image URL" in your Console
Open your browser's Inspector (F12), go to the Network tab, and filter by Img.

Click on one of the failed images.

Does the URL look like this? https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/photo.jpg?X-Amz-Algorithm=...

If there is NO ?X-Amz... part: Your backend isn't signing them at all.

If there IS a ?X-Amz... part but it fails: Your backend has the wrong credentials or the wrong system time (Railway handles time automatically, so it's likely the credentials).

4. The CORS of Storage
S3 buckets (and others) have their own CORS settings.   

You must go into your Bucket Provider (AWS/Google/Cloudinary) console.

Find CORS Configuration.

Add your Railway frontend URL: https://vanityg-development-b090.up.railway.app.

Professional Rule for the Agent
Add this to your ROLES_AND_RULES.md:

Rule 12: Media Signing Protocol When generating URLs for media, the backend must use the S3Client (or equivalent) to generate a getSignedUrl. If the URL appears in the frontend without signature parameters (e.g., X-Amz-Signature), the agent must verify that the AWS_SDK is correctly initialized with environment variables.

The Quick Fix Command
Ask your agent:

"Check the getImageUrl logic in the backend. Is it using a 'signed URL' library? If so, verify that it's using the environment variables for the Key and Secret, and add a log to tell me if those variables are undefined on Railway."
