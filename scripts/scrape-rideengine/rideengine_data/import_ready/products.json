We are issuing this bulletin to share details about a rare but important issue identified with the Hyperlock harness system and to provide clear steps to ensure your harness continues to perform as intended. A very limited number of riders have reported spreader bar slippage under extreme load conditions. While these cases are uncommon, we take every instance seriously. To address this, we have implemented a design upgrade component that fully eliminates the possibility of slippage. Potential Risk In the rare event of slippage, the spreader bar may shift or release unexpectedly, which could compromise your connection to the harness and result in a loss of control. Your Choice and Confidence Even though this issue is rare, your comfort and peace of mind matter most. If you feel uncertain about using your harness, we encourage you to request and install the free Design Upgrade component for your harness before your next use. How to Identify if Your Harness Is Impacted Step 1: Identify Ratchet Receiver Type Impacted harnesses have an open receiver on the ratchet body (see illustration below). Only the following harness models/years are affected: 2025 production year Hyperlock. If you are unsure whether your harness is impacted, please visit our support page and our Rider Support team will help you confirm. Step 2: Identify if T-Nuts are Exposed If T-Nuts are exposed the HyperLock Design Upgrade Kit can be installed on your harness If T-Nuts are not exposed please contact our Rider Support Team and they will assist you further.",
