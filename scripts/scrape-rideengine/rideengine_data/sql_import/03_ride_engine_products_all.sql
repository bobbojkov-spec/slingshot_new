<h3 class="p1"><strong>Ride Engine Safety Bulletin: Hyperlock Harness</strong></h3>
<p class="p1">Your safety is our highest priority. We are issuing this bulletin to share details about a rare but important issue identified with the Hyperlock harness system and to provide clear steps to ensure your harness continues to perform as intended.</p>
<p class="p1">A very limited number of riders have reported spreader bar slippage under extreme load conditions. While these cases are uncommon, we take every instance seriously. To address this, we have implemented a design upgrade component that fully eliminates the possibility of slippage.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><strong>Potential Risk</strong></h3>
<p class="p1">In the rare event of slippage, the spreader bar may shift or release unexpectedly, which could compromise your connection to the harness and result in a loss of control.</p>
<h3 class="p1"><strong>Your Choice and Confidence</strong></h3>
<p class="p1">Even though this issue is rare, your comfort and peace of mind matter most. If you feel uncertain about using your harness, we encourage you to request and install the free Design Upgrade component for your harness before your next use.</p>

<p><strong>• Stability</strong><br><strong>• Flotation</strong><br><strong>• Impact Protection</strong><br><strong>• Improved Handling</strong><br><strong>• Reduced bow spray</strong><br><strong>• Ability to carry more equipment</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Have specific questions or need more details? Reach out! Our PWC specialists are here to help — contact us at <strong><a href="info@rideengine.com">info@rideengine.com</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>PRO MODEL COLLAR ADVANTAGES</strong></p>
<p>For the Pro model, the main difference lies in its enhanced construction. We have introduced a Traction Top layer, which provides excellent grip when stepping onto the collar. This layer not only ensures good traction but also offers superior UV protection and helps prevent accidental punctures. Additionally, the Pro model features our new TPU molded handles, which are our proprietary design. These handles are tall and easy to grab, with just the right amount of flex, providing an exceptional level of functionality and comfort.</p>
<p>The Ride Engine PWC Inflatable Collar stands out as a custom-designed solution, meticulously crafted to match the specific dimensions of your PWC. Constructed using durable and UV-resistant PVC, this inflatable collar serves the dual purpose of enhancing watercraft stability while preserving agility and maneuverability. Moreover, it offers an additional layer of protection and safety for riders who may come into contact with the PWC during rider acquisition along with providing crucial impact protection for the watercraft itself.</p>
